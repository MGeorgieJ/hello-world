**First repository**

Hey, I've never tried to code and this is a first attempt to learn. 
Up to now, this has been a lot of learning and trying to retain what was learned. 
It's quite challenging but we shall see how it goes.

**Patience**



If a string is in a knot,

Patience will untie it.

Patience can do many things—

Did you ever try it?



If it was sold at any shop

I should like to buy it.

But you and I must find our own—

No other can supply it.
