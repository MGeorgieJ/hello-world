**First repository**

Hey, I've never tried to code and this is a first attempt to learn. 
Up to now, this has been a lot of learning and trying to retain what was learned. 
It's quite challenging but we shall see how it goes.

**Patience**

If a string is in a knot,
Patience will untie it.
Patience can do many things—
Did you ever try it?

If it was sold at any shop
I should like to buy it.
But you and I must find our own—
No other can supply it.
